Changes from 2.4 to 2.5
 1) Added new package ceGUI that extends the wxPython framework by adding such
    things as logging and saving/restoring settings automatically
 2) Added new module ceDatabase which supports common tasks when dealing with
    sets of data in databases; works with both cx_Oracle and ceODBC
 3) In cx_Win32Service, removed extraneous code; used cx_Logging instead of
    print statements; added a Service object to support getting information
    about and controlling services; added support for getting a list of
    service names starting with a particular string
 4) In cx_ClassLibrary, ensured that a class can be built that does not require
    any arguments in its constructor
 5) In cx_XML, removed code for SAX parser since the cElementTree module is
    far more efficient and is not builtin to Python 2.5 and higher
 6) In cx_OptionParser, simplified the interface for determining if traceback
    is desired or not
 7) In cx_Threads, correctly specify the logging statements so that the
    presence of a % character in the message does not cause an exception to be
    raised

Changes from 2.3 to 2.4
 1) In cx_ClassLibrary, improved class factory class.
 2) In cx_Exceptions, used the original arguments when formatting the message
    rather than the repr so that the strings are interpolated correctly.
 3) In cx_Exceptions, replaced message "Unhandled exception." with the normal
    Python error message string that would be displayed.
 4) In cx_Exceptions, transformed syntax errors into something that is more
    useful.
 5) In cx_LoggingOptions, added support for --max-files and --max-file-size
    when running a server.
 6) In cx_LoggingOptions, installed exception handler which will log exception
    information to the log file with considerably more information than just
    the traceback; automatically forced sys.stderr and the log file to be
    identical in order to capture any extraneous errors that the OS might
    produce in the log file.
 7) In cx_OptionParser, filtered out future warnings completely since they are
    of benefit only to developers.
 8) In cx_ReadLine, fix handling of redirection of stderr on Windows since
    that platform handles that quite horribly.
 9) In cx_Win32Service, wait until the service is actually started or stopped
    before continuing.
10) In cx_XML, removed method for writing binary data since it is not being
    used and cannot be seamlessly interpreted; added a method instead that
    allows for writing uninterpreted data which can be used to write arbitrary
    data (including base64 encoded data) if an application requires it.
11) In cx_XML, encoded carriage return (chr(13)) in XML files since XML
    parsers are required to translate all combinations of carriage return and
    line feed into a single line feed.
12) In cx_XML, added support for specifying the encoding for an XML file.
13) Removed support for Python 2.2.

Changes from 2.2.1 to 2.3
 1) Added new module cx_DatabaseTable which provides a simple class that
    transforms tuples (such as those returned by cx_Oracle) into an instance
    with attributes that can be refereced.
 2) Added new module cx_LoggingOptions to support handling of standardized
    logging options.
 3) Added new module cx_Handles to handle providing integer handles to an
    external application which cannot handle Python objects directly.
 4) Added new module cx_Tracing to handle tracing of Python code.
 5) Added new method for transforming text given a set of delimiters and a
    method to manage the transformation in cx_Utils.
 6) Added new method for returning a default value when a key is not found in
    cx_IniFile rather than raising an exception.
 7) Added new class ClassFactory to cx_ClassLibrary which allows for the
    dynamic creation and caching of classes.
 8) Added support for defining arguments independently of a parser in
    cx_OptionParser so that they can easily be defined in modules as constants.
 9) Added support for defining arguments that must be integers in
    cx_OptionParser.
10) Added support for CDATA and better pretty printing in cx_XML.
11) Added support for getting a choice from a list of choices in cx_ReadLine.
12) Added support for logging exceptions, starts and stops of threads in
    cx_Threads.
13) Added method InlineIf() to cx_Utils for conditional expressions similar to
    those added in Python 2.5.
14) Removed cx_Freezer since that is properly part of the cx_Freeze project.
15) Improved CaselessDict in cx_ClassLibrary.
16) Improved handling of exceptions in cx_Exceptions.
17) Improved output for the CVS log report in cx_CVS.
18) Replaced cx_Queue with an implementation in cx_Threads that allows multiple
    producer and consumer threads.
19) Replaced cx_ServiceFramework with cx_ServerFramework which now uses the
    increased functionality in cx_Threads and cx_Logging.
20) Check the return status of commands executed in cx_Utils.
21) Use a leading underscore in front of argument names in cx_XML so that they
    do not conflict with the XML file being parsed.
22) Fixed bug in cx_IniFile when the first line of an ini file is a comment.
23) Fixed bug in cx_XML when non ASCII characters are found in the input.
24) Options or arguments are no longer checked for values in cx_OptionParser
    if they are not marked as required.

Changes from 2.2 to 2.2.1
 1) cx_IniFile now has a Read() method which will raise an exception if the
    file does not exist.
 2) If the directory to be removed does not exist, retreat to a safe directory
    as otherwise Windows will raise an error that the directory cannot be
    deleted.
 3) Make setup.py compatible with Python 2.3.
 4) Fix handling of dead revisions in cx_CVS.
 5) Allow for spaces in passwords when connecting to a CVS server.
 6) Provide for a more flexible method of handling a variable number of
    arguments in cx_OptionParser.
 7) Added the logging module from Python 2.3 so that Python 2.2 code can use
    it.

Changes from 2.1 to 2.2
 1) Print information about the files written or copied during the freezing
    process as a convenience for users of cx_Freeze.
 2) Do not copy extensions when freezing if the path is being overridden since
    it is expected that a full Python installation is available to the target
    users of the frozen binary.
 3) Provide meaningful error message when the wxPython library cannot be
    found during the freezing process.
 4) Include updated versions of Python 2.3 modules textwrap, modulefinder
    and optparse.
 5) Include Python 2.3 modules _strptime and tarfile which are also used
    internally.
 6) cx_CVS now logs dead revisions properly.
 7) cx_CVS now uses a file containing a description of the CVS tags to
    print a meaningful report since CVS itself does not contain information
    about the tags and how they relate to each other in a project.
